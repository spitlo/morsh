All glyphs are chosen from [this list](https://github.com/ehmicky/cross-platform-terminal-characters) of "All the characters that work on most terminals".

At the moment, there are two working versions: one written in Bash and one written in V. My ~~plan was~~ hope is to rewrite it in a few different languages that I’ve been wanting to try out.

## Building

To build the `karakter` binaries, you need to install the corresponding languages.

Each version has build instructions in their separate READMEs, but generally you can build any version by running `bin/build <language>` from the root folder. For example, running:

```bash
bin/build v
```

will build the V version (given that you have V installed.) You can then run it by typing:

```bash
v/karakter
```

All commands might not have the exact same set of options, but all should present you with a help text when run without any arguments.

The Bash version, available at `bash/karakter` does not need any installation, you should be able to run it as-is with bash 4.x or 5.x but it’s not comprehensively tested.

## Output examples

### Input text

```txt
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
```
